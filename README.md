# SNAKE

In this classic arcade game, you play as a hungry snake navigating a rectangular grid. Your goal is to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the walls and yourself. The snake grows longer with each piece of food consumed, making it increasingly challenging to maneuver. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction and try to achieve the highest score possible. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
